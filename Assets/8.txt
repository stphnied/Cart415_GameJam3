Doctor: Usually the motor skill memories stay intact, weâ€™ll keep you for a few days just to make sure everything is fine. We have already contacted your family and they should start visiting later today. I suggest you try to talk with your friends, family and acquaintances. The interactions might help you regain some memories you lost.
