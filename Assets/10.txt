Lance: Anyway, I’m Lance. We’ve been best friends since like middle school. 
I got the call from the doctor that you woke up.I just came to check in early, since the majority of your family lives far away. 
I’ll be the one to take you back when you are released. In the meantime, I’m free for a quick interrogation right now. So what do you want to know?
