V: Not much, honestly, but I do know what you're talking about. It's more if I try to think about someone or an event there’s nothing.
Doctor: Usually the motor skill memories stay intact, we’ll keep you for a few days just to make sure everything is fine. 
We have already contacted your family and they should start visiting later today. I suggest you try to talk with your friends, family and acquaintances. 
The interactions might help you regain some memories you lost.

Doctor: Seems one of your most frequent visitors is here.

Doctor: Sara is not here with you today? I thought she would be the first one to come once Vane woke up.
???: No, she said …she was busy today.
Doctor: I see.
*the doctor leaves and the man walks closer.
???: Hey Vane, it’s been a hot minute. How was the nap?
